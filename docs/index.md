> The first fully open source modern phone

![[logo-text.png|600]]

Everest aims to build the first fully open-source, modern smartphone â€” including hardware, software, and documentation.

## About

Everest isn't just about building a phone, it's about documenting the process to support and inspire future projects. It serves as a technical journal, development log, an engineering guide and educational resource, all in one.

It's written not just for end users, but for developers, engineers, researchers, and anyone interested in building open source hardware.
