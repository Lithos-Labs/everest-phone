> Summary of some ideas discussed in a private chat with ChatGPT on 2025-01-05 about how I would make a commercial user phone.

This was based primarily after seeing the failure of  [[Preliminary Research#Google's Arora|Google's Arora]] and my appreciation but misalignment of values with the [[Preliminary Research#PinePhone|PinePhone]].

Even though some things are simply unrealistic for a small scale project like the current one (and even for a startup), it still can serve as a general guideline for the values of the phone.

## Core Philosophy

The primary focus is **user-first**:

- **Convenience** and **utility** for the consumer are paramount.
- **No exploitation of users** for corporate gain, ensuring honesty and transparency.
- The **consumer is king**, with rights that include:
    - **Full ownership** of the product upon purchase.
    - **The right to repair** or even manufacture the product if needed.
    - **Longevity**: the phone should last as long as the user wants it to.
    - **Privacy**: the user’s right to anonymity and privacy should be facilitated as much as possible.
    - **Personalization**: the phone should cater to the user’s specific needs, with full transparency (no hidden clauses).

**Sustainability** is secondary in this project, as the focus lies primarily on **user rights and product quality**.

## Pricing & Profit

- **Price** should be as low as possible, reflecting only the true cost of the phone.
- A **5% profit margin**, dedicated to improving the next model.
- Competing on **philosophy** rather than price alone.

## Target Model

- **Default model** will be **mid-range**, with a focus on affordability.
- **Upgradeable** to flagship specs, though the price may increase due to customization options and advanced features.

## Customization & Modularity

- **Customization** is key, but not in the complex fashion of Google’s Ara.
- Parts left underperforming in the default model:
    - **Processor**
    - **RAM**
    - **Display**

### Hotswap & Component Customization

- **Hotswapability**: components like the battery and back panel can be easily removed or replaced.
- **Internal components**: mic, speaker, camera, RAM, etc. will be screwable for user upgrades.
- **Multiple tiers**: at least two versions of every component available in-store (with some pieces offering even more variety).

## Privacy Features

- **Privacy controls**: manual screws can be used to physically disconnect components (e.g., camera, microphone, GPS) for those concerned with privacy.
- A focus on making these features **hard to break** and ensuring **full transparency** in how the user’s data is handled.
